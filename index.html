          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface 
           design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. </p>

          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term "web design" is normally used to describe 
           the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. </p>

          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup 
           then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>Although web design has a fairly recent history. It can be linked to other areas such as graphic design, user experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a technological standpoint. 
           It has become a large part of people's everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, videos and music.</p>

            <h2>Familly is Love</h2>
            <p>What is important to me is my family because they took care of me and my parents worked hard to get me to go to a private school. What I remember then, that I asked for stuff from 
             my dad when he was still working, he gave it to me right away, so I became a spoiled kid. But now I’ve changed because I realize they’re criticizing blood and sweat, they can only 
             give me what I need.</p>

            <p>I solved that by praying to the lord not to continue committing suicide but I have a lot to do in life and the child cup to commit suicide. I first rested in my room for a few months
             to think about what I needed to do to get rid of the depression and anxiety. My advice to net readers, at first you will give up on life but sooner or later, you will realize that the 
             people you hear are right for you to rise again. Just pray to the Lord to heal you and guide you not to be left behind.</p>

        <p>Hi, I’m Rafael S. Fernandez. I live in an affordable family but there is a problem coming up in our family. I am a kind person when the person I am talking to has respect for me, but when there 
        is no respect for me, the wind blows out of me. When I was a child, my mommy said that I was sick as a child and I did therapy because it was difficult for me to speak as a child, and I also did 
        therapy on my feet, so I couldn't walk. But I am thankful to god because it has changed me a lot now. </p>
